Gladiator's Tale is an intense action game where you step into the sandals of a gladiator, fighting for your freedom in the brutal world of the arena. Customise your appearance and go for it! You will face increasingly difficult opponents and obstacles along the way.

You are going to fight against other gladiators every day and the game gets progressively harder as you go with you facing stronger and stronger enemies. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter a range of characters, from fellow gladiators to treacherous scammers, each with their own motivations and agendas. Will you make friends, forge alliances, or take advantage of others to achieve your goals and the freedom you desire?

The game features a range of mechanics, from hidden puzzles and secrets to unexpected twists and turns. And with four possible endings to discover, you'll be kept on the edge of your seat until the very end.

But be warned: the world of Gladiator's Tale is a dangerous one, and death is always just around the corner. Will you rise to the challenge and claim your freedom, or fall victim to this brutal world?

- Fight every day, if you die you lose your unsaved progress

- Manipulate and help, scam and get scammed, make friends or enemies! The choice is yours!

- 4 possible endings! Can you complete them all?

- A narcissistic bully who hates you by default

- A drunk dude cause why not?
