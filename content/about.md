# About Me

Hi! I'm Xavier Lopes, I have a Masters Degree in Physics Engineering. And so, I have an interest in electronics and engineering.

I also have interests in Game Development and participated in multiple GameJams as well as having published a title on Steam: Gladiators Tale.
Finance and investing in general is also an area I am quite passionate about.

## My Story

I always had an interest for discovering new things and creating experiences and that motivation is what led me to the path I am today.

I have worked on many projects throughout my life, from silly Roblox experiences, to carbon dioxide sensors.

Outside of work, you'll often find me hiking, surfing, skating, snowboarding, biking, climbing, or similar activity. I am a fan of extreme sports and nature sports.
