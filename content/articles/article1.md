## Introduction

Market Data is quite a precious information, which price can go to the tens of thousands of dollars. This means that in order for the price to be worth it, one should be "playing" with significantly large sums of money.

Unlike films, books, video games and other forms of media that are easy to pirate, market data is hard to access through illegal means.

This is especially true in the derivatives market, most notably, options historical data is huge and expensive, since each day there's multiple option contracts with  multiple expirations, strikes and prices.

This article shows an alternative method on how to backtest options strategies with only free information from the web, specifically, S&P daily close price, VIX and the black-scholes model.
